# Sort Unix 
[![Run on Repl.it](https://repl.it/badge/github/kgashok/sortUnix)](https://repl.it/github/kgashok/sortUnix)

Click the above `"run on repl.it"` gray button to launch or visit http://j.mp/sortDemo 

## What to do? 
  1. Press the green "run" button above 
  2. Observe what happens on the console on the right. 

## Part 1 - Objectives  
"_Begin with the end in mind_"

  1. Observe how sort command works in Unix
  2. Read strings from text file (names.txt)
  3. Sort the strings and show the output
  4. Add "india" to the names.txt file 
  5. Sort the strings again and show the output
  6. Add your name to the file names.txt 
  7. Press the "run" button again - see where your name appears in the list   

  or listen to http://j.mp/unixSortDemo


## Files description 
  - main.sh - which executes every time you press the green "run" button  
  - names.txt - text file to edit your name into 


## Part 2 - Objectives  
"_Going from Known to Unknown_"
  1. Make sure you know the pseudo code (aka Python) for the Selection Sort algorithm 
  > - practice the http://j.mp/selectionSortCC - Python exercise on CloudCoder 

  2. Review the file selectsort.md 
  3. Come prepared to share and write the algorithm on the board 

## Part 3 - Objectives  
"_Pre-requisite knowledge is critical_"  

  0. If a character array is of length 15, what is the range of the valid index values? 
     - 0 to 15 
     - 1 to 15 
     - 1 to 14
     - 0 to 14
     - None of the above
  
  1. Make sure you know how `strcmp` function works. Visit https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/strcmp-in-c-cpp/
  2. What is code snippet to swap two character array variables in C? 
  3. By the way, what happens when you run `sort numbers.txt`?
  
## Part 4 - Challenge yourself! 
"_I find that I don’t understand things unless I try to program them._"  — Donald E. Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Volume 4 

Listen to http://j.mp/unixSortKey video series. 
    - Or if you prefer images http://j.mp/selectSortC

Write code along the same steps on http://j.mp/selectionSortC and pass all the test cases
    - If you practice well, and compete in the liveCoding session, and finish all the test cases < 6 min, you can win upto Rs 1,000 worth of gift prizes
    - Be among the **First 3** to complete to maximize your prize money

## Part 5 - The Pointer Version!
"_Learning algorithms without implementing them is like learning surgery based solely on reading an anatomy book._" - Alexander S. Kulikov and Pavel Pevzner

And if you can complete the pointer version of the code within 6 min, and answer questions on the code, you can win upto Rs 3,000 worth of gift prizes  
    - To really _**grok**_ the algorithm in the pointer version, launch the visualizer and single step through it - http://bit.ly/visualSort
    - Be among the **Best 3** to complete the challenge to maximize your prize money

## Part 6 - Advanced Challenge
_"Go where no man or woman has gone before!"_

- A more efficient SelectionSort using MinMax values - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sorting-algorithm-slightly-improves-selection-sort/
